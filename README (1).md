### Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development, facilitating collaboration and version control. Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code over time, allowing developers to revert to previous states, branch off for new features, and merge work seamlessly. This capability is vital for managing complex projects and tracking development history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a centralized location for projects, enabling teams to share code, review changes, manage issues, and contribute to open-source software, making it the industry standard for collaborative coding and project management.
